🚀 Diving Deep into OCD Patient Data: A Comprehensive Analysis! 🧠📊 

I'm excited to share my latest project, where I analyzed a dataset of OCD patients to uncover meaningful insights that could inform better healthcare decisions. This analysis explores various aspects, from demographic trends to clinical features, and highlights the complex relationships between obsessions, compulsions, and comorbidities like depression and anxiety.

Key Insights:
🔍 Distribution of age, gender, and ethnicity among OCD patients
🔍 Patterns in the duration of symptoms and family history of OCD
🔍 The relationship between obsession/compulsion types and Y-BOCS scores
🔍 Prevalence of comorbidities like depression and anxiety
🔍 Medication trends across different patient profiles

Tools & Skills Utilized:
💡 Excel for data manipulation and initial exploration
💡 SQL for complex queries and deep dives into specific trends
💡 Power BI for creating interactive visualizations that bring data to life
